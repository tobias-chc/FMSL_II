# Course Notes for DSBD2-001: Foundations of Statistics and Machine Learning Part II

## Motivation

As my first course as a full-time student at DSTI, I have decided 
to start taking notes in a useful format (in my opinion) to review all 
the contents in an easy and comprehensible way. 

You can view the resulting output here:

1.  [**Web page**](<https://tobias-chc.github.io/FSML_II/>)

2.  [**HTML**](docs/index.html)

3.  [**PDF**](docs/index.pdf)


## Limitations

These notes were designed for my own use. As such, it
comes with no guarantees.

Please do let me know if you find any typo or error on it.
